# Customers & orders

Covers per-store customer profiles, favorites, want lists, customer carts, local test orders, owner order management, customer order history, notifications, and sales reports.

A `StoreCustomer` links a global `User` to a specific `Store` with a unique `user_id + store_id` pair. Favorites and want-list entries hang off that customer row.

Create-on-write: read endpoints do not create customer rows. They return an empty representation if the user has no `StoreCustomer` yet, and the row is created lazily on the first write.

Customer routes are under `StoreCustomerController` at `/api/stores/{slug}/customer`, gated by `ROLE_USER`. Owner order routes are API Platform `Order` operations under `/api/stores/{slug}/orders`, gated by `STORE_MANAGE`.

| Feature | Route(s) |
|---------|----------|
| Profile | `GET /api/stores/{slug}/customer`, `PATCH /api/stores/{slug}/customer` |
| Favorites | `GET /favorites`, `PUT /favorites/{itemId}`, `DELETE /favorites/{itemId}` |
| Want list | `GET /want-list`, `POST /want-list`, `DELETE /want-list/{id}` |
| Cart | `GET /cart`, `PUT /cart/{itemId}`, `DELETE /cart/{itemId}`, `DELETE /cart` |
| Local test order | `POST /test-order` |
| Customer order history | `GET /orders` |
| Customer notifications | `GET /notifications`, `PATCH /notifications/{id}/read` |
| Owner orders | `GET /api/stores/{slug}/orders`, `POST /api/stores/{slug}/orders`, `GET /api/stores/{slug}/orders/{id}`, `PATCH /api/stores/{slug}/orders/{id}` |

## Customer profile

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph FE["Frontend: CustomerProfilePage.tsx"]
        show["useCustomerProfile(slug)"]
        save["api.patch('/stores/{slug}/customer')"]
    end
    show --> rt1["GET /api/stores/{slug}/customer"]
    save --> rt2["PATCH /api/stores/{slug}/customer"]
    rt1 --> sc1["StoreCustomerController::show()"]
    rt2 --> sc2["StoreCustomerController::update()"]
    sc1 --> find["StoreCustomerRepository::findOneForUserAndStore()"]
    sc2 --> getor["StoreCustomerRepository::getOrCreateForUserAndStore()"]
    find --> db["store_customers SELECT"]
    getor --> dbw["store_customers INSERT/UPDATE"]
```

`update()` validates payment metadata before persisting. No card numbers are stored; only brand, last4, and expiry metadata are accepted.

---

## Favorites and want list

Favorites point at concrete `InventoryItem` rows, so the favorited item must belong to the requested store. Want-list entries may point at a shared catalog `Card`, but `card_id` is optional so customers can request cards that are not in the local catalog yet.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph FE["Frontend: CustomerProfilePage.tsx / CardDetailsPage"]
        fav["favorites GET/PUT/DELETE"]
        want["want-list GET/POST/DELETE"]
    end
    fav --> ctl["StoreCustomerController"]
    want --> ctl
    ctl --> customer["StoreCustomerRepository"]
    ctl --> inv["InventoryItemRepository"]
    ctl --> card["CardRepository"]
    ctl --> db["store_customers, customer_favorites, customer_want_list_entries"]
```

| Layer | Where |
|-------|-------|
| Frontend | `pages/CustomerProfilePage.tsx`, `hooks/useCustomer.ts`, `components/cards/*` |
| Controller | `Controller/StoreCustomerController.php` |
| Repos | `StoreCustomerRepository`, `CustomerFavoriteRepository`, `CustomerWantListEntryRepository`, `InventoryItemRepository`, `CardRepository` |
| DB | `store_customers`, `customer_favorites`, `customer_want_list_entries` |

---

## Cart and local test checkout

The cart is customer-scoped and store-scoped. In local development, the cart can be converted into an unpaid `pending` order without Square.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor Customer
    participant FE as CartPage.tsx
    participant Ctl as StoreCustomerController
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    participant Admin as OrdersTab.tsx

    Customer->>FE: Add inventory items to cart
    FE->>Ctl: PUT /customer/cart/{itemId}
    Ctl->>DB: upsert cart item for StoreCustomer
    Customer->>FE: Create test order
    FE->>Ctl: POST /customer/test-order
    Ctl->>DB: create orders + order_lines
    Ctl->>DB: clear customer cart
    Ctl-->>FE: Order(status=pending)
    Admin->>Ctl: GET /api/stores/{slug}/orders
```

- `POST /customer/test-order` is available only in `dev` and `test`. In other environments the controller returns `404`.
- The test order path does not charge Square or PayPal. It exists so order history, owner fulfillment, print sheets, notifications, and Mailpit email can be tested locally.
- The frontend exposes the action when `import.meta.env.DEV` or `VITE_ENABLE_TEST_CHECKOUT=true`.

---

## Owner order management

Orders are API Platform resources. Store owners read orders through `StoreOrderCollectionProvider`, can create manual orders through `StoreOrderProcessor`, and update status through `StoreOrderStatusProcessor`.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph FE["Frontend: store admin"]
        ot["OrdersTab.tsx"]
        badge["AdminLayout active-order badge"]
        reports["ReportsTab.tsx"]
    end
    ot --> route["GET/PATCH /api/stores/{slug}/orders"]
    badge --> route
    reports --> route
    route --> read["StoreOrderCollectionProvider / StoreOrderItemProvider"]
    route --> create["StoreOrderProcessor"]
    route --> write["StoreOrderStatusProcessor"]
    read --> repo["OrderRepository::findByStore()"]
    create --> db
    write --> db["orders UPDATE"]
    repo --> db2["orders JOIN order_lines"]
```

Current primary workflow:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> pending
    pending --> received
    received --> fulfilled
    pending --> cancelled
    received --> refunded
    fulfilled --> [*]
    cancelled --> [*]
    refunded --> [*]
```

Legacy statuses are still accepted for existing data and reports: `paid`, `shipped`, and `completed`. The frontend normalizes `paid` and `shipped` into the active received step and treats `completed` as fulfilled.

The order detail panel includes a print sheet action. The print sheet renders order reference, date, customer, card name, set, collector number, quantity, unit price, line total, pre-tax total, tax, and post-tax total. Tax is currently displayed as `$0.00` because tax calculation is not persisted yet.

---

## Customer order history

Customers see their own store-specific order history from the profile page.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    profile["CustomerProfilePage orders tab"] --> hook["useCustomerOrders(slug)"]
    hook --> route["GET /api/stores/{slug}/customer/orders"]
    route --> ctl["StoreCustomerController::orders()"]
    ctl --> repo["OrderRepository::findByStoreAndCustomerEmail()"]
    repo --> db["orders JOIN order_lines JOIN cards"]
```

Orders are matched by the authenticated user's email and the current store. Serialized lines include card images, set code, and collector number so the profile page can show the ordered card image and printing details.

---

## Notifications and email

In-app notifications are persisted in `customer_notifications`; email is a delivery side effect. The database notification is the source of truth for the bell, unread count, and profile notification list.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor Owner
    participant FE as OrdersTab.tsx
    participant API as PATCH /orders/{id}
    participant P as StoreOrderStatusProcessor
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    participant Mail as Symfony Mailer / Mailpit
    participant Bell as NotificationBell

    Owner->>FE: Mark order fulfilled
    FE->>API: PATCH status=fulfilled
    API->>P: process(order)
    P->>DB: update order status
    P->>DB: insert customer_notifications row
    P->>Mail: send fulfilled email
    Bell->>DB: poll GET /customer/notifications
```

- A notification is created when an order first transitions to `fulfilled` or legacy `completed`.
- The processor looks up the `User` by `orders.customer_email`. If no matching user exists, no customer notification is created.
- Duplicate fulfilled notifications are prevented by checking `(user, order, type)`.
- Mail delivery uses Symfony Mailer. Local development sends to Mailpit via `MAILER_DSN=smtp://127.0.0.1:1025`; the UI is at `http://localhost:8025`.
- If Mailpit is not running, the processor catches transport errors so the in-app notification is still saved.
- The frontend polls notifications every 15 seconds and refetches on mount, reconnect, and window focus. Realtime SSE/WebSocket delivery is a future upgrade.

| Layer | Where |
|-------|-------|
| Backend entity | `Entity/CustomerNotification.php` |
| Backend repo | `Repository/CustomerNotificationRepository.php` |
| Fulfillment side effects | `State/StoreOrderStatusProcessor.php` |
| Customer routes | `Controller/StoreCustomerController.php` |
| Frontend hooks | `hooks/useCustomer.ts` |
| Frontend UI | `components/notifications/NotificationBell.tsx`, `NotificationList.tsx`, `pages/CustomerProfilePage.tsx` |
| DB | `customer_notifications` |

## Reports

Reports reuse the owner orders list. Revenue totals, pending/refunded totals, average order value, and per-status breakdown are computed client-side in `ReportsTab.tsx`. There is no backend aggregation endpoint yet.

| Layer | Where |
|-------|-------|
| Frontend | `pages/store-admin/OrdersTab.tsx`, `ReportsTab.tsx`, `components/orders/*`, `lib/orders.ts` |
| Routes | `GET /api/stores/{slug}/orders`, `POST /api/stores/{slug}/orders`, `GET /api/stores/{slug}/orders/{id}`, `PATCH /api/stores/{slug}/orders/{id}`, `POST /api/stores/{slug}/customer/test-order` |
| API Platform entry | `State/StoreOrderCollectionProvider.php`, `StoreOrderItemProvider.php`, `StoreOrderProcessor.php`, `StoreOrderStatusProcessor.php` |
| Customer controller | `Controller/StoreCustomerController.php` |
| Repo/DB | `OrderRepository`, `OrderLineRepository`, `CustomerNotificationRepository`, `CardRepository` -> `orders`, `order_lines`, `customer_notifications`, `cards` |

## Known gaps

- Real payment capture is not wired into checkout yet. Square OAuth account linking exists, but test orders bypass payment providers.
- Tax and shipping are not calculated or stored on orders yet.
- Notifications are polling-based, not pushed in realtime.
- Fulfillment email is plain text and does not use templates or per-user notification preferences yet.
